Maximize-CPA
============

Maximize-CPA is a simple way to fix the issue with maximized Chrome Packaged App on Windows. It allows your users using Windows to maximize your app without hiding their taskbar.

**Warning: Maximize-CPA only works with frameless apps.**

##Installation

Maximize-CPA is under MIT licence and has been made to be really simple to use. 

Download `maximize-cpa.min.js` in "released/1.0" and include it in your project (see the Chrome Packaged App contained in the folder "project" to have an example). 

The only thing to do then is to link your button "Maximize" with the function `maximizeWindow()` and everything should work.

At present, Maximize-CPA has only been tested on Windows 8.1, your feedback would be appreciated.
